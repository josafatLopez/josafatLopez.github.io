The risk? A technical DevOps initiative that consumes a lot of time and budget but falls short of delivering the expected benefits to the business." }

According to Gartner, around 75% of DevOps initiatives fail to deliver the expected results." },

Being around in the industry for almost 10 years, DevOps has proven to deliver successful results to some organizations, but nothing more than a painful journey to many others. Why is that?" }

These practices are of course enabled by tools and technology, but they are adopted by people. What makes teams effective is not the tools or the infrastructure assets they use, but the practices they adopt and how well those are defined, tailored to the specific context of the organization." },

What is the challenge then? Developing the culture within the IT organization that allows for the necessary change in people’s mindsets, and hence in their practices, to support a successful DevOps approach. That is what makes DevOps successful for only a few!" }

The effect that this creates is better known as a “cultural debt”. As a financial debt, the longer it accumulates, the higher the cost a cultural debt will bring to the organization for not having addressed the cultural implications on time." },

Only then will DevOps be what it is meant to be." }
