In the end, DevOps is necessary because businesses need to deliver better software products faster to their customers, but there will be other specific requirements in every business that drive a DevOps adoption." },

But let’s get right to the point." }

Beyond understanding “what your business needs”, we need to ask ourselves (and explain to all the stakeholders of course!) “Why” DevOps is necessary. If you cannot answer this question, then it’s very likely you don’t really need DevOps. You may still adopt it even if you don’t know “why” it is necessary, but I’m afraid you won’t be able to inspire most people to embrace it, and moreover demonstrate too much strategic or business value from the initiative or program." },

As Simon says (literally), and I quote: “If you don’t know why you do what you do … how will you ever get people to vote for you or buy something from you, or more importantly, be loyal?”. Even before thinking what your business needs, ask yourself why your organization needs DevOps. That’s probably the ultimate first step to take when adopting DevOps." },

Now you need to build everything from here, linking your strategy to your drivers, your plans to your strategy, your operational targets to your plans, and your practices and tools to your targets, and then develop people’s capabilities and skills based on the practices and tools you need to have in place. Only then you will be able to deliver actual business value from DevOps." }

Operational practices and tools are necessary, but linking them all the way up to a strategy and business drivers will definitely increase the success of your overall DevOps program, even at the most operational and technical levels." }
